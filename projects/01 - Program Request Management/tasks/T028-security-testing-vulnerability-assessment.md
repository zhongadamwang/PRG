# T028 - Security Testing and Vulnerability Assessment

**GitHub Issue:** #28
**Issue URL:** https://github.com/zhongadamwang/PRG/issues/28

## Description

Comprehensive security testing including authentication, authorization, data protection, and vulnerability scanning. This ensures the system meets security requirements and protects sensitive data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Security Controls**: All authentication and authorization controls work correctly when conducting security tests
- [ ] **Vulnerability Assessment**: No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are found when scanning for security issues

## Tasks

- [ ] Create comprehensive security test suite
- [ ] Conduct authentication and authorization testing
- [ ] Perform data protection and privacy validation
- [ ] Execute vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- [ ] Test input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Validate session management and security
- [ ] Test API security and endpoint protection
- [ ] Conduct security configuration review
- [ ] Create security remediation plan
- [ ] Validate security fixes and improvements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Security test suite validates all access control scenarios
- [ ] Vulnerability scan shows acceptable security posture
- [ ] Security testing covers all critical attack vectors
- [ ] Security remediation addresses all identified issues
- [ ] System meets organizational security standards

## Dependencies

- T026: System Integration Testing (requires completed system)

## Linked Requirements

- R-029: Integration with organizational security systems
- R-030: Role-based access control and security

## Risk Factors

- **Complex AD integration security requirements**: Integration may have security implications
  - *Mitigation*: Work with security team to validate integration approach early
- **New security vulnerabilities**: Testing may discover unexpected security issues
  - *Mitigation*: Plan time for security remediation and re-testing

## Estimated Effort
2.5 days (comprehensive security testing)
