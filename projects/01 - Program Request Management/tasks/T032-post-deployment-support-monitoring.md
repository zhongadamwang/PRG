# T032 - Post-Deployment Support and Monitoring

## Description

Establish ongoing support procedures, performance monitoring, and continuous improvement processes. This ensures successful system operation and ongoing enhancement after deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Support Processes**: Clear escalation and resolution procedures are available when issues arise
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Key performance indicators are tracked and reported when system operates normally

## Tasks

- [ ] Create comprehensive support procedures and documentation
- [ ] Establish incident response and escalation processes
- [ ] Implement ongoing performance monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Set up user feedback collection and improvement processes
- [ ] Create system maintenance and update procedures
- [ ] Build continuous improvement framework
- [ ] Establish KPI tracking and business metrics reporting
- [ ] Create support team training and knowledge transfer
- [ ] Implement proactive monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Develop long-term system evolution planning

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Support documentation and procedures are established and tested
- [ ] KPI tracking provides ongoing system health visibility
- [ ] Incident response procedures ensure rapid issue resolution
- [ ] Continuous improvement process drives ongoing enhancements
- [ ] Support team is prepared for ongoing system operation

## Dependencies

- T031: Production Deployment Preparation (requires production deployment)

## Linked Requirements

None directly linked - supports ongoing system operation and improvement

## Risk Factors

- **Insufficient support resources**: Support team may be understaffed or unprepared
  - *Mitigation*: Plan support capacity and train multiple team members
- **Lack of continuous improvement**: System may stagnate without ongoing enhancement
  - *Mitigation*: Establish regular improvement cycles and user feedback loops

## Estimated Effort
1.5 days (support procedures and monitoring setup)
