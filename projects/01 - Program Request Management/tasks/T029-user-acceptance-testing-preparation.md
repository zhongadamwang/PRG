# T029 - User Acceptance Testing Preparation

**GitHub Issue:** #29
**Issue URL:** https://github.com/zhongadamwang/PRG/issues/29

## Description

Prepare UAT environment, create test scenarios, and coordinate stakeholder testing activities. This ensures all stakeholder groups can effectively validate the system meets their needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **UAT Environment**: Stakeholders can complete all defined test scenarios successfully when testing the system
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: All core workflows are validated by actual users when running UAT

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up dedicated UAT environment with production-like data
- [ ] Create comprehensive UAT test scenarios and scripts
- [ ] Develop stakeholder testing guide and documentation
- [ ] Coordinate UAT schedules with all stakeholder groups
- [ ] Prepare test data and sample scenarios
- [ ] Create UAT feedback collection and tracking system
- [ ] Train stakeholders on UAT process and expectations
- [ ] Implement UAT issue tracking and resolution
- [ ] Create UAT sign-off and approval process
- [ ] Document UAT results and recommendations

## Definition of Done

- [ ] UAT environment supports all stakeholder testing requirements
- [ ] UAT scenarios cover all critical business workflows
- [ ] Stakeholders are prepared and trained for testing
- [ ] UAT process ensures comprehensive user validation
- [ ] UAT feedback leads to system improvements

## Dependencies

- T027: Performance Testing and Optimization (requires performance validation)
- T028: Security Testing and Vulnerability Assessment (requires security validation)

## Linked Requirements

- R-047: User interface and workflow validation by stakeholders

## Risk Factors

- **Stakeholder availability for testing**: Key users may have limited time for testing
  - *Mitigation*: Schedule UAT sessions well in advance and provide flexible testing options
- **UAT scope creep**: Stakeholders may request changes during testing
  - *Mitigation*: Set clear UAT scope and change management process

## Estimated Effort
2.0 days (UAT preparation and coordination)
