- **NF3**: Process must integrate seamlessly with current workflows
- **NF4**: Documentation must evolve with the product

### System Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Internal team skill development, process adaptation, existing tool enhancement
- **Out of Scope**: New tool procurement, external consultant hiring, complete process overhaul

## WHEN - Timeline and Milestones

### Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Skill framework development (Weeks 1-3)
- **Phase 2**: Team capability assessment (Weeks 4-5)  
- **Phase 3**: Learning pathway creation (Weeks 6-8)
- **Phase 4**: Pilot implementation (Weeks 9-12)
- **Phase 5**: Evaluation and refinement (Weeks 13-14)

### Critical Milestones
- **M1**: Comprehensive skill framework documented - Week 3
- **M2**: Current team capabilities assessed - Week 5  
- **M3**: Learning and development plan created - Week 8
- **M4**: Pilot implementation launched - Week 9
- **M5**: Success metrics achieved - Week 14

### Dependencies and Constraints
- Stakeholder interviews must complete before assessment begins
- Learning plan depends on completed skill gap analysis
- Pilot implementation requires management approval
- Timeline flexibility required due to ongoing project commitments

## WHERE - Context and Environment

### Operational Environment

- **Team Structure**: Cross-functional squads with mixed skill levels
- **Work Environment**: Hybrid office/remote setup
- **Communication**: Existing Slack, Teams, and documentation platforms

### System Integration Points
- **Version Control**: Enhanced Git workflows for evolutionary practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Adaptation for iterative deployment cycles
- **Documentation**: Integration with current wiki and knowledge base
- **Project Management**: Enhancement of existing Jira/planning tools

### Environmental Constraints
- Must work within current tech stack limitations
- Remote team members require equal access to training
- Integration with existing security and compliance requirements

## WHY - Purpose and Business Rationale

### Business Drivers
- **Primary**: Improve development team agility and responsiveness to change
- **Secondary**: Enhance team member job satisfaction and retention
- **Strategic**: Position organization for competitive advantage in fast-changing market

### Success Metrics
- **Quantitative**: 
  - 25% reduction in feature delivery time
  - 50% improvement in requirement change adaptation speed
  - 90% team member completion of skill development program
- **Qualitative**: 
  - Improved team confidence in handling evolving requirements
  - Enhanced collaboration between development and business teams
  - Better alignment of development output with business needs

### Value Proposition
- Enhanced ability to respond to market changes and customer feedback
- Reduced risk of project delays due to requirement changes
- Improved team resilience and adaptability
- Better customer satisfaction through responsive development

## HOW - Implementation Approach and Methods

### Technical Approach
- **Methodology**: Competency-based learning with practical application
- **Framework**: Incremental skill building with regular feedback loops
- **Assessment**: Multi-source feedback including self, peer, and manager evaluation
- **Tools**: Integration with existing development environment and workflows

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Discovery Phase**: 
   - Conduct stakeholder interviews to understand current challenges
   - Research industry best practices in evolutionary development
   - Analyze current team capabilities and process effectiveness

2. **Design Phase**:
   - Create comprehensive competency framework for evolutionary development
   - Design learning pathways tailored to identified skill gaps  
   - Develop assessment methodology and success metrics

3. **Development Phase**:
   - Build training materials and practical exercises
   - Create assessment tools and feedback mechanisms
   - Develop integration guides for existing workflows

4. **Deployment Phase**:
   - Launch pilot program with volunteer team members
   - Provide ongoing coaching and support
   - Collect continuous feedback and adjust approach

5. **Evaluation Phase**:
   - Measure results against defined success metrics
   - Collect lessons learned and improvement suggestions
   - Plan organization-wide rollout strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Team resistance to change in established processes
  - **Mitigation**: Involve team members in framework design, emphasize benefits, start with volunteers
- **Risk**: Time constraints affecting training completion  
  - **Mitigation**: Integrate learning with regular work, provide flexible scheduling, management support
- **Risk**: Lack of sustained adoption after initial training
  - **Mitigation**: Create ongoing reinforcement mechanisms, peer support networks, regular check-ins

### Quality Assurance
- Regular checkpoint reviews with stakeholders and participants
- Continuous feedback collection through surveys and interviews  
- Measurable success criteria validation at each phase
- Iterative refinement based on pilot program results
